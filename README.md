A Collection of My Finest Creations in Code (and by “finest,” I mean “hopefully functional”)

Welcome to Vitomir's Code Gallery – Full Stack Development student, aspiring wizard of ones and zeroes, and proud member of Group G5! Below, you’ll find a curious collection of my homework assignments, which, like fine wine, may improve over time (though results may vary).

FAQs:

Q: Is it going to be pretty?
A: No. But beauty is subjective, right?

Q: Is it going to be correct?
A: I hope so. I promise I’ve triple-checked… probably.

Q: Will this make my teachers question their career choices?
A: Almost definitely. But at least they’ll laugh along the way.

What You’ll Find Here

  	* 	JavaScript Adventures: Watch me tackle async functions and hope for the best.
	*	CSS Creativity: Sometimes intentional, sometimes accidental.
	*	HTML Hierarchies: A nested list here, a missing tag there… classic stuff.

Stay tuned for more of my “masterpieces” – if nothing else, they’ll give you a laugh or two!
