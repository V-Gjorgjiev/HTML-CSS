        We may also collect personal information about you from your use of other Optical Eyes! Group websites or
        services.
        <br><br><br>
        How and why do we use your personal data?
        <br><br><br>
        We process your personal information for the following reasons, to help us provide you with the best possible
        eye and hearing health care and customer experience. We will only process your personal information if we have a
        lawful basis (reason) to do so. We rely on the following lawful bases to collect and process your personal
        information;
        <br><br><br>
        Legitimate interests - It is in our genuine interests to process your information for the following purposes to
        make sure we provide you with a professional eye and hearing service in the most secure and appropriate way:
        <br><br><br>
        To perform eye and hearing tests so we can understand your eye and hearing health and any medical conditions.
        To work out and dispense your prescription for glasses, contact lenses or hearing aids.
        To book your eye and hearing tests.
        To confirm your appointment. We will send you confirmation by email and text message if you book online. We will
        also send you a reminder a short period before the appointment is due.
        To contact you about changes to our service that could affect or inconvenience you.
        To send you eye test reminders. Changes in your eyesight are usually very gradual, so regular eye tests are
        important.
        To send you communications about looking after your eye and hearing health, and information about correcting
        your vision.
        To send you direct marketing communications about our products, offers and discounts. You can opt out of these
        communications at any time.
        To send you surveys and to ask for feedback to help us improve our service and make our service and products

        help us improve our service.
        If you are browsing our website, we will not collect any information which will identify you by name. However,
        we will collect information using cookies or traffic data which uses IP addresses or other numeric identifiers
        to analyse how people use our website. See our Cookie Policy for more information about cookies and how we use
        them.
        To communicate with you about health care information, special offers and discounts that are relevant to you.
        To respond to complaints, queries and any claims made against us.
        To ensure the safety and security of our customers when in our stores.
        To understand the experience of our customers when in-store. This helps us to identify the strengths and
        weaknesses of our customer service, and can be used to inform a development strategy for improving customer
        experiences.
        Please note, we will communicate with you using the communication preferences you give us. This may include by
        post, email, text message, phone or on social media.
        <br><br><br>
        Contractual obligations - we rely on the responsibilities set out in our contract with you when we process your
        information in order to keep to any arrangements we have made with you. This may include for the following
        reasons:
        <br><br><br>
        To manage your online account.
        To process transactions when you buy any of our goods and services.
        To process your credit-card or debit-card information when you are paying for goods and services, or when we are
        dealing with refunds.
        To provide you with our products and services.
        To meet the obligations we have under our contract with you.
        Legal obligations - there may be times when we have a legal reason for needing to share and process your
        personal information you have given us, including for the following reasons:
        <br><br><br>
        We may need to make your personal information available to other optometrists, medical practitioners, health and
        social care providers, or the NHS.
        We may need to respond to any complaints or claims we receive from our regulators or other third parties. Our
        regulators might also ask for information when carrying out their work.
        We may need to share your information with other third parties who have a legal right to access it (for example,
        the police, our insurers, external auditors, and investigators).
        We may need to share your information with companies who provide us with your updated personal information, such
        as changes to your contact information or deceased indicators (notice of your death).
        We will need to process your information if you ask us for a copy of the personal information we are holding.
        This is known as a 'subject access request' and is one of the rights you have under the General Data Protection
        Regulation (GDPR).
        We have to process your personal information to meet our responsibilities as registered and dispensing
        optometrists and audiologists.
        We may need to share your information to help prevent and detect fraud, and to protect the health and safety of
        members of the public, our staff and our customers.
        We may have to share your personal information to meet our corporate responsibilities, including during company
        mergers and when buying or selling assets.
        In line with our rights under relevant data-protection law, there may be times when we will anonymise your
        personal information. That means any details which could be used to identify you, such as your name, will be
        removed so that you can no longer be identified. We may use this anonymised information:
        for statistical research, and publication purposes; and
        to develop and improve future treatments, and the accuracy of core health-care technologies (health machines
        such as cameras which detect eye disease) and related products and medicines.
        Consent - we rely on your consent (permission) to process your personal information within the Optical Eyes!
        Group, and will ask you to provide this:
        <br><br><br>
        when you enter one of our competitions;
        when we use facial scanning services to deliver personalised experiences in-store; and
        when you use our virtual try-on service online.
        How long do you keep my information for?
        <br><br><br>
        We and other members of the Optical Eyes! Group will keep personal information for as long as is reasonably
        necessary (or as defined under healthcare laws and regulations which apply) to provide products and services,
        including aftercare services, and to maintain records as needed to satisfy tax and other legal or regulatory
        requirements, as well as to protect and defend against claims. Once it is determined that there is no longer a
        legal basis to retain your Personal Data, it may be deleted or anonymised where it can no longer be used to
        identify you directly or indirectly.
        <br><br><br>
        We de-identify (anonymise) your personal data so that it does not directly or indirectly identify you for the
        following purposes; concerning health for future scientific and historical research purposes, analytics, and
        statistical purposes to develop and improve new treatments and programs of healthcare, related services, and
        products.
        <br><br><br>
        Who do you share personal information with?
        <br><br><br>
        We may share your personal information with other members of the Optical Eyes! Group for any of the reasons we
        have given in this privacy policy.
        <br><br><br>
        Each of our stores is run by a company within the Optical Eyes! Group. When you place an order for products or
        services in a store, the data controller of the personal information will be that store. Optical Eyes! Optical
        Group will process that information, including any health information, on behalf of the store. Optical Eyes!
        Optical Group also provides IT, marketing and other services for each store and processes any personal
        information relating to these services.
        <br><br><br>
        We may share your personal information with other people when it is necessary to do so, including for the
        following reasons:
        <br><br><br>
        We use other organisations to help us process personal information, but they are not allowed to use it for any
        other purposes. We may use the information we are given from other organisations to add to and improve our
        databases of customer details.
        We may reveal personal information to health authorities, including the NHS or national equivalent
        organisations.
        We may pass personal information to external agencies and organisations, including the police and other
        law-enforcement agencies, to prevent and detect fraud (including fraudulent transactions) and criminal activity.
        These external agencies may check the information we give them against public and private databases and may keep
        a record of those checks to use in future security checks.
        If a claim is made, or could be made, against us or other members of the Optical Eyes! Group, we may pass
        personal information to our insurers.
        If we sell or buy any business or assets, we may reveal personal information about you to the seller or buyer.
        If we (or our assets) are bought or taken over by another organisation (or there is a reorganisation within our
        corporate group), personal information we hold about customers will be one of the assets transferred.
        We may pass certain personal information to your employer if you have been referred to us as a corporate
        eye-care customer.
        We may pass your personal information to others:
        if we have to by law (including under a court order);
        to apply our Terms and Conditions of Use of Website ('Terms of Use') or the terms of other agreements we have
        with you; and
        to protect our rights, property and safety and those of our customers, employees or others.
        We may share an anonymised version of your email address to third-party social media sites, such as Facebook, to
        enable us to display marketing to you. When we do this, we use a process called 'hashing' to protect your
        details. This is where we scramble the plain text of your email address into a unique and irreversible
        collection of numbers and letters so that your email address cannot be recognised. When we do this, social media
        providers are only allowed to use your information to display our marketing to you through their site and not
        for any of their own purposes. You can update your social media privacy preferences on your own social media
        accounts.
        We may share an anonymised version of your personal information or clinical test results (or both) to
        third-party equipment and technology suppliers or research institutions:
        to provide you with clinical care (including your eye or hearing test);
        to help the suppliers continually improve their products and test equipment (which means we can then provide you
        with the best care); and
        for the purposes of clinical research.
        How do you process my personal information?
        Sometimes it may be necessary to share your personal information with our business partners (other
        organisations), or other members of the Optical Eyes! Group who provide services for us. This may mean sharing
        your information outside of the UK, European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), including in the USA.
        Please note, when information is shared outside of the UK, EU and EEA, it may be handled according to local
        laws.
        <br><br><br>
        If we need to share your personal information outside of the UK, EU or EEA, we will make sure that the transfer
        is in line with data-protection law.
        <br><br><br>
        Our contracts with the overseas companies we share personal information with will include standard clauses which
        are approved by the European Commission for transferring information from the EU. Where necessary, we will put
        further measures in place to protect your information. These clauses, and any further measures, make sure that
        your information is protected in the same way as it would be in the UK, EU and EEA. If you would like a copy of
        our standard contractual clauses, please write to our Data Protection Officer at Data Protection Office, Forum 6
        Parkway, Solent Business Park, Whiteley, Hampshire, PO15 7PA

        account (if you are a registered online customer), or by contacting customerservice@opticaleyes.com
        <br><br><br>
        What rights do I have?
        <br><br><br>
        You have certain rights under UK data-protection law, including the right to:
        <br><br><br>
        access your personal information (we may charge a fee if we are allowed to do so by law); and
        correct your personal information if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
        You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal information and to stop processing it if we have no
        legal basis to keep storing or processing it. This includes if:
        <br><br><br>
        we no longer need your personal information for the purpose originally collected or processed it for;
        you withdraw your permission;
        you object to us processing your personal information;
        you ask us to stop processing your personal information (although we are entitled to store your personal
        information, we cannot process it further if you ask us not to);
        we move or transfer your personal information to another organisation; or
        you object to us processing your personal information if we are processing it:
        based on our legitimate interests (our business purposes)
        for direct marketing; or
        for scientific or historical research and statistical purposes.
        To exercise of the above rights, please contact your Optical Eyes! store, or if you are a registered online
        customer, contact customerservice@opticaleyes.com or fill in an online form.

        You have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner's Office. They can investigate whether
        organisations are keeping to data-protection law. For more information, visit ico.org.uk.
        <br><br><br>
        What choices do I have?
        <br><br><br>
        We may use your personal information to contact you about our products and services.
        <br><br><br>
        If you do not want to receive marketing material (including special offers and discounts), you can let us know
        in-store, by emailing customerservice@opticaleyes.com or by phoning the customer service team on 070 123 456.

        You can choose to stop receiving marketing emails from us by following the unsubscribe link and instructions in
        the marketing emails we send you.
        <br><br><br>
        How do you protect my personal information?
        <br><br><br>
        We use the following security technology and methods to help protect your personal information from unauthorised
        access and use.
        <br><br><br>
        Encryption, meaning that information is hidden so that it cannot be read without special knowledge (such as a
        password). This is done with a secret code (a cypher). The hidden information is said to be 'encrypted'.
        Using a different name for you so we can hide parts of your personal information.
        Controlling access to systems and networks. This allows us to stop people who are not allowed to view your
        personal information from getting access to it.
        Training our staff so they know how to handle personal information and how and when to report when something
        goes wrong.
        Regular testing of our technology and ways of working, including keeping up to date on the latest security
        updates.
        We have no control over the contents of other websites or resources which are linked to our website. We accept
        no responsibility for them or the privacy practices they use, or for any loss or damage that results from you
        using those websites or resources.
        <br><br><br>
        Updating our Privacy Policy
        <br><br><br>
        We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Any updates will take effect as soon as they are posted on
        our website.
        <br><br><br>
        Contact us
        <br><br><br>
        If you have any questions about this privacy policy, or you would like to change any of the preferences you have
        chosen, visit us in-store or online or write to Data Protection Officer, Data Protection Office, Forum 6
        Parkway, Solent Business Park, Whiteley, Hampshire, PO15 7PA.
