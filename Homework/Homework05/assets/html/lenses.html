                    Proper care can make a big difference in the lifespan of your eyewear.
                    <br>
                    Always use a soft microfiber cloth for cleaning and avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the
                    lenses.

                    When not wearing your glasses, keep them in a case to prevent scratches. Following these simple tips

                    Good eye health goes beyond regular checkups.
                    <br>
                    Eating a balanced diet rich in vitamin A, avoiding smoking, and taking regular breaks from screens
                    can all contribute to healthier eyes.
                    <br>
                    Practice the '20-20-20 rule'—every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds—to
                    reduce digital eye strain.

                    Understanding Myopia, Astigmatism and More
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Many people experience common vision issues like myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia
                    (farsightedness), and astigmatism.
                    <br>
                    These conditions can often be corrected with glasses, contact lenses, or even corrective surgery.
                    <br>
                    Talk to our optometrists about the best options for your needs.

                <h5>
                    Myopia (Nearsightedness)
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a common condition where close objects appear clear, but distant
                    objects appear blurry.
                    <br>
                    This happens when the eye is too long, causing light to focus in front of the retina.
                    <br>
                    Myopia can usually be corrected with prescription glasses, contact lenses, or, in some cases, laser
                    eye surgery.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Hyperopia (Farsightedness)
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Hyperopia, or farsightedness, is the opposite of myopia. People with hyperopia can see distant
                    objects more clearly than close ones.
                    <br>
                    This occurs when the eye is too short, causing light to focus behind the retina.
                    <br>
                    Corrective options include glasses, contact lenses, and, for some, laser surgery.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Astigmatism
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Astigmatism is caused by an irregularly shaped cornea or lens, which prevents light from focusing
                    evenly on the retina.
                    <br>
                    This results in distorted or blurred vision at all distances.
                    <br>
                    Glasses or contact lenses with a special cylindrical lens power can correct astigmatism, and laser
                    surgery is also an option.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Presbyopia
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Presbyopia is an age-related condition where the eye's lens becomes less flexible, making it
                    difficult to focus on close objects.
                    <br>
                    This typically begins around age 40 and can be corrected with reading glasses, bifocals,
                    multifocals, or progressive lenses.
