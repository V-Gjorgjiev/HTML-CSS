            Eminem's journey into rap began as a teenager when he developed a passion for storytelling and rhyming. He spent years honing his craft in Detroit's underground rap scene, where he adopted the stage name “M&M,” later stylized as Eminem. His big break came in 1999 with the release of The Slim Shady LP, produced by hip-hop legend Dr. Dre. This album introduced Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and became an instant commercial success, winning him a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. Songs like My Name Is showcased his dark humor and unapologetic style, sparking both praise and controversy.

            Following The Slim Shady LP, Eminem released The Marshall Mathers LP in 2000, which shattered records as the fastest-selling solo album in U.S. history at the time. With hits like The Real Slim Shady, Stan, and The Way I Am, the album displayed his lyrical prowess, introspective storytelling, and ability to blend deeply personal experiences with commentary on fame and societal issues. Stan, a track exploring the dangers of obsessive fan culture, is considered one of his greatest works and has become a cultural reference.

            In 2002, Eminem released The Eminem Show, which further cemented his reputation as a rap icon. That same year, he starred in 8 Mile, a semi-autobiographical film that chronicled a young rapper's rise in the Detroit battle rap scene. The movie was a commercial success and showcased Eminem's acting talents, earning him an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Lose Yourself, a high-energy anthem about perseverance and self-belief.

            Despite his success, Eminem faced personal challenges, including struggles with drug addiction and mental health issues. Following the release of Encore in 2004, he took a hiatus to focus on his recovery. He returned in 2009 with Relapse, an album that documented his battle with addiction, showcasing a darker side of his storytelling as he addressed his time in rehab and his fight to regain control over his life. Although Relapse received mixed reviews, Eminem's dedication to his craft remained evident, and he followed up with Recovery in 2010. Recovery was a commercial success and was praised for its introspective themes, signaling a new chapter in Eminem's life as he embraced sobriety. Tracks like Not Afraid and Love the Way You Lie featuring Rihanna became massive hits, with Love the Way You Lie topping the charts globally and resonating with listeners for its depiction of turbulent relationships.

This album showcased his lyrical maturity and nostalgia for his earlier work, blending his classic style with new influences. Songs like Rap God highlighted his technical skill, with Eminem setting a world record for packing the most words into a hit single, further proving his mastery of wordplay and complex rhyme schemes.

Each album displayed his ability to adapt to changing musical landscapes while staying true to his style. Kamikaze saw him responding to critics and younger rappers with a renewed aggressiveness, reminding fans of his sharp wit and fearlessness. Music to Be Murdered By, inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, showcased a mix of introspection and societal commentary, tackling themes like mental health, gun violence, and self-reflection.
